# This property defines the firmware compatibility, i.e. on which systems MLL
# will be bootable.
#
#  bios - the generated ISO image will be compatible with legacy BIOS systems.
#         This is the default option and it does not require root privileges.
#
#  uefi - the generated ISO image will be compatible with UEFI systems. This
#         option requires root privileges.
#
#  both - the generated ISO image will be compatible with both legacy BIOS and
#         modern UEFI systems. This option requires root privileges.
#
FIRMWARE_TYPE=both

# Use predefined '.config' file when building the kernel. This overrides the
# config generation in 'xx_build_kernel.sh' and the build process uses the
# config file provided in this parameter. Place the configuration file here:
#
# minimal_config/kernel.config
#
USE_PREDEFINED_KERNEL_CONFIG=false

# Use predefined '.config' file when building BusyBox. This overrides the
# config generation in 'xx_build_busybox.sh' and the build process uses the
# config file provided in this parameter. Place the configuration file here:
#
# minimal_config/busybox.config
#
USE_PREDEFINED_BUSYBOX_CONFIG=false

# Define the overlay type to use. Possible values are 'sparse' and 'folder'.
# You can use any other value, no value, or comment the property in order to
# disable it. Put your overlay content in the folder 'minimal_overlay/rootfs'
# and it will be automatically merged with the root file system on boot. The
# build process creates either '/minimal.img/rootfs' or '/minimal/rootfs' (read
# below) and this folder contains all overlay content in it. The build process
# also creates '/minimal.img/work' or '/minimal/work'. This folder is used by
# the overlay driver to store modifications related to the read only storage.
# If the overlay media is writeable, then all changes on the root filesystem
# are automatically persisted and preserved on reboot.
#
# sparse - use sparse file 'minimal.img' with hardcoded maximal size of 3MB
#          (see 'xx_generate_overlay.sh'). The generated ISO image is larger,
#          because the sparse file is treated as regular file. This option
#          requires root permissions or otherwise sparse file generation is
#          silently skipped. Sparse file is treated as separate disk image and
#          works fine on FAT.
#
# folder - use normal folder structure (/minimal/). Note that this doesn't work
#          if the file system is FAT because FAT requires special handling,
#          e.g. POSIX overlay (http://sf.net/p/posixovl). This is the default
#          option because it doesn't require root permissions.
#
OVERLAY_TYPE=folder

#
# -- see MLL version of config. --
#
# Refer to the MLL's README file for more information.
#
# Each bundle can have separate '.config' file which overrides any property
# which has been provided in this configuration file. Refer to the README
# file for more information.
#
# The line below is sample which provides Open JDK, Apache Felix and Links.
# There is also network functionality provided by the 'dhcp' overlay bundle.
#
# OVERLAY_BUNDLES=dhcp,felix,links,openjdk
#
# The default overlay bundles of MLL are 'dhcp', 'mll_logo' and 'mll_source'.
# Suggested option: dhcp,glibc_full,bosh_cli,cf_tools,coreutils,dialog,dropbear,fio,golang,graalvm,links,lua,make,nano,ncurses,nweb,openjdk,static_get,util_linux,vim,zlib
#
OVERLAY_BUNDLES=dhcp

# The location where the overlay bundle software will be stored.
#
# rootfs - all overlay bundles will be embedded in the initramfs. In this way
#          the software will be available on boot but the initramfs size may
#          grow significantly and MLL will require more RAM in order to boot.
#
# iso    - all overlay bundles will be packed in the ISO image structure. The
#          actual location depends on the value of the configuration property
#          'OVERLAY_TYPE'.
#
OVERLAY_LOCATION=iso

# Always use local source bundles. This is useful when you have downloaded the
# sources and have no internet connection, or if you want to share your version
# of 'Minimal Linux Live' with predefined sources.
#
USE_LOCAL_SOURCE=false

# This property enables the standard penguin boot logo in the upper left corner
# of the screen. The property is used in 'xx_build_kernel.sh'. The default
# value is 'true' for demonstration purposes.
#
USE_BOOT_LOGO=false

# This property is the multiplicator which is used during the build process.
# The total number of each 'make' jobs will be equal to the number of detected
# CPU cores mutiplied by this property. For example, if you set this property
# with value '2' and if your CPU has 4 cores, then the number of 'make' jobs
# will be 4 * 2 = 8.
#
JOB_FACTOR=2

# This property defines the default GCC flags to be used during the compilation
# process. You can use your own flags here or even completely remove the flags.
#
CFLAGS=-Os -s -fno-stack-protector -fomit-frame-pointer -U_FORTIFY_SOURCE
